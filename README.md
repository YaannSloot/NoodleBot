# THICCBot4Java

## How to run the bot
Requirements:
* A Discord bot to run the program on
* A WolframAlphaAPI AppID
* Java JRE or JDK

To run the bot, enter this command in a bash shell or windows cmd

```java -jar <path to bot jar file> <bot token> <wolfram app id>```

## Warnings
If you are forking, creating a pull request, or commiting any sort of information or code to github, DO NOT leave a discord bot token in your commits. Your bot will be hijacked. Trust me, it has happened before. Your bot may last a week at most.
